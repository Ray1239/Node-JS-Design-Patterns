# Node.js Design Patterns Repository

This repository is a collection of code snippets and theory from the renowned book *Node.js Design Patterns* by Mario Casciaro. It serves as a comprehensive reference for understanding and implementing design patterns in Node.js.

## Chapter 1: Node.js Design Fundamentals

### Introduction
Chapter 1 of the book delves into the foundational principles and design philosophies of Node.js. It explains the core patterns and mechanisms that make Node.js efficient and suitable for building scalable, non-blocking I/O applications. Key topics include the reactor pattern, the Node.js module system, and the callback conventions that underpin its asynchronous nature.

### Summary

#### The Node.js Philosophy
- **Small Core**: Node.js maintains a lightweight core to ensure flexibility and simplicity.
- **Small Modules**: Encourages creating small, single-purpose modules to foster modularity and reusability.
- **Small Surface Area**: Limits the API surface area to make Node.js easier to maintain and understand.
- **Simplicity and Pragmatism**: Focuses on practical solutions rather than theoretical perfection.

#### The Reactor Pattern
- **I/O is Slow**: Recognizes that I/O operations (e.g., file and network access) are inherently slow.
- **Blocking vs Non-blocking I/O**:
  - Blocking I/O: Operations block the execution thread until completion.
  - Non-blocking I/O: Operations do not block; results are handled via callbacks or events.
- **Event Demultiplexing**: Uses a single thread to manage multiple I/O events efficiently.
- **libuv**: Implements the reactor pattern as the non-blocking I/O engine for Node.js.

#### The Callback Pattern
- **Continuation-Passing Style**:
  - Synchronous: Directly passes results.
  - Asynchronous: Uses callbacks to handle results once available.
- **Node.js Callback Conventions**:
  - Callbacks come last.
  - Error comes first: Errors are passed as the first argument to callbacks.
- **Unpredictable Functions**:
  - Handles synchronous and asynchronous execution scenarios to avoid issues like "unleashing Zalgo."

#### The Module System and Its Patterns
- **Revealing Module Pattern**: Encapsulates functionality and reveals specific methods for use.
- **Node.js Modules**:
  - `module.exports` vs `exports`: Clarifies the use of exports for defining modules.
  - The Resolving Algorithm: Explains how `require` resolves module paths.
  - The Module Cache: Demonstrates how Node.js caches loaded modules.
  - Cycles: Explains how Node.js handles cyclic dependencies.
- **Module Definition Patterns**:
  - Named Exports
  - Exporting Functions and Constructors
  - Exporting Instances
  - Modifying Other Modules or the Global Scope

#### The Observer Pattern
- **EventEmitter**:
  - Core mechanism for implementing the observer pattern in Node.js.
  - Allows objects to emit events and other objects to listen for them.
  - Supports propagating errors and combining with callbacks.
  - Can make any object observable for synchronous or asynchronous events.

### Key Patterns Covered
- Reactor Pattern
- Callback Pattern
- Revealing Module Pattern
